        <h1>hi maria</h1>
        <h1>you've reached the end</h1>
        <p>thank you so much for playing. maybe you thought all of this was a really big waste of time. and it was.</p>
        <p>but I had so much fun making it. I've had a lot of time on my hand in Sweden. I'm typing this from the apartment in gothenburg with the two tuxedo cats, if you remember. 20:01 on January 7th. you texted me earlier that your mom broke your coffee pot :/ and then you had to call one stop. Double :/</p>
        <p>today for breakfast you were making toast with a bit of cream cheese and strawberry jam and two eggs. I think that sounds so scrumptious.</p>
        <p id="dateMessage">I miss you so much, and can't wait to be back with you. by the time you're reading this, I hope we've have had many wonderful weeks in the dorms together. I don't know how long it took you to complete this, but happy birthday or happy late birthday or happy valentine's day baby</p>
        <p>I love you so much more than I could ever put into words. My life is so much better with you in it. I hope you're doing bombastically wonderful at the moment.</p><p>Honey, you're genuinely wonderful and amazing in every way and I love you with all my heart. </p>
        <p>Always yours,</p>
        <p>Alexander</p>
